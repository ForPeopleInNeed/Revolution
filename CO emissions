Damage have been done and being done to global environment by Tallink Silja Lines Ferry's
                                          
Report:
1. Inside ferry, parking space.
When vehicles do drive inside ferry obviously do burn CO. Drivers and passengers are in must to pass area full of CO just to make way to they cabins inside ferry. There is no any protection is provided to customers. 
2. After arriving from point A to point B Tallink Silja Lines  customers must come 
back to they vehicles and pass the same area which is obviously  a little cleaner. And here comes one more issue when heavy trucks has to start they diesel engines to pump air in to they systems. In that time other drivers and passengers are forced to breath huge amounts of CO.
3. Nothing have been done to make sure that burned fuel do go safely out of ferry parking space.
Means such a big amounts of CO do go out without any solutions made to clean it.
4. Damage of Fossil fuels burned by ferry's to global environment.
 Ignorance of new technology solutions and money rush problem do poison air which all nature environment has to breath. 
5. irresponsible amount of ferry's  crossing Baltic sea do generate  irresponsible amount’s of CO emissions to air.
6. By collected information ferry's always do go half full. In which case fossil fuel have been burn in the amounts as full. There is no planing done to reduce CO emissions.
7. Parked ferry keep turned on engines. It need to supply needed electric power. It means that huge engines has to run for 7 Hours and burn fuel which also creates bad CO emissions. No actions has been taken. There no even look like any actions have been planed.
8. Every public transport supplier is in must to have place for waiting people whom can stay worm inside. No matter Bus stations, Train station, Airports, or ports. When people do come earlier and waiting inside the cars it is obvious that they will burn fuel in cold weather so here We coming once more with CO problem which generates  same lines without taking any actions nor planing to.
9. Cruise Ships being run for no any other reason except making money. This mighty ships creates Big CO emissions.
10. No needed lines must be suspended. Only ferry left and no more then 2 times per week from.
