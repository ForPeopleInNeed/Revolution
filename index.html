<p>World free of money
Edition 1: (to be updated)</p>

<pre><code>                                      System
</code></pre>

<p>Introducing new system it isn't easy task.
  It will be work to do to make people to understand the system.</p>

<p>We start with food industry. most important for human beeing</p>

<p>All the systems will work on calories based information.</p>

<p>Main goals of calories system is that every one will get as much as need food.
  And not as much they want. This will be a little harder think to do. So We must take it in very reponsible matters.
  Fat people are to addictive to food and they bodies are bigger so We must Understand that they will need a little more calories.
  Calories will be introduce to every person in the way how hard person works.
  Worker Whom use more fisical energy will be entitled to get more food.
  It is imortant to balance food as there some has way to much and other's has non. 
  A lot of shops do wasting a lot of food. It must stop. Costs of all needed energy to produce, then simply wasting it which does cost resourses and clean air on the planet. so it time beeing shops must learn how much food need to have in store.
  The system will be introduce in next way.
  How are We going to Understand how much one or the other person used calories per single day. 
Well to have this information We will need to equip every person with devices which shows how much calories person burning per day. </p>
